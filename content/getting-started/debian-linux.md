## Installation Requirements
To follows these instructions you need an operating system on you machine which is not Windows. We recommend the latest version of Ubuntu LTS. If you choose to not use Ubuntu LTS be sure that the flavor of linux you are using has support for the following packages:

  * [git 2.x](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  * [clang 3.9.0+](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html)
  * [gcc-arm-none-eabi 4.7.1+](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download)
  * [python3 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * python3-pip



## Installing Required Components
If you are installing on Ubuntu there is an install script available which should handle most of the process. The script can be downloaded from Github [here](link to install script)
