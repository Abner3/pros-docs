1) Install [Python 3][https://www.python.org/downloads/] for macOS.
2) Download the [PROS installer][fakeProsInstallerLink] and run it. You will need to input an administrator's password, and you must remain connected to the internet for the duration of installation. The installer will download Atom.app and the ARM toolchain to /Applications/PROS_2.0, and will use pip3 to install the command line interface. You will be able to see the progress of the installer in a Terminal window automatically openned by the installer. 
3) Open Atom (/Applications/PROS_2.0/Atom.app) and verify that PROS appears in the menu (Likely next to Help). 
4) Congratulations! You have successfully installed PROS for OS X. For advanced syntax checking and code completion within Atom, consider downloading [Xcode][https://developer.apple.com/xcode/] or [LLVM][http://llvm.org]. Note that Xcode is likely easier to install than LLVM, though it must be opened at least once.
